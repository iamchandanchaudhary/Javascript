India won its second ever ODI world cup after defeating Sri Lanka in the <b>final</b> with Dhoni being named man of the match for scoring an unbeaten 91. In December 2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years and Dhoni top-scored in all the three matches of the series with a century in the first ODI at Chennai. Dhoni led India to victory in the <a id="link2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_ICC_Champions_Trophy"><b>2013 ICC Champions Trophy</b></a> and became the first and the only captain in international cricket to claim all ICC limited overs trophies. In the rain-shortened final against England, India won by five runs on DLS method though Dhoni himself was out for a duck. He was also named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.</p>
